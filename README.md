# Auto-PlayerPOV (Saved Replays)

Tired of opening a saved replay and manually fishing through the player list and camera settings every time you open a replay? **Auto-PlayerPOV** handles the setup for you. 

The moment you load a saved match replay, the plugin automatically snaps the camera to your car's perspective. No more menu-fiddling, just load in and watch that insane psycho or mechanical clip exactly how you lived it.

### **Quick Start:**
* **One-Time Setup:** Just jump into a single Freeplay session or match. The plugin will automatically "lock in" your profile.
* **Auto-Focus:** From then on, every saved replay you open will start with the camera focused on YOU.
* **The "Clip-Back" Hotkey:** Switched to Fly cam to see a different angle and want to snap back instantly? Set this up:
   1. Open BakkesMod (**F2**) -> **Bindings** tab.
   2. Click **Add** and pick a key (like `P` or `NumPad1`).
   3. Type this command: `replay_focus_me`

### **Why use it?**
* **Skip the Setup:** Goes straight to your POV the second the replay starts.
* **Won't Mess With You:** It only triggers once at the start. If you manually change your camera mid-replay, it stays exactly where you put it.
* **Set and Forget:** Remembers who you are even after you restart Rocket League.

**Note:** If you change your name or switch accounts, just hit the **"Reset Profile"** button in the plugin settings to lock in your new identity.
